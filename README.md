# Eureka-chat

Hi all,
       This is my our first repository which is planning to build a universal chat room. It will allow anyone in the world to join the chat and can have discussions, debates, Q&A and many more features with integration to all popular discussion sites. It will also have one-on-one chat, groups for different topics. We will add more details and also will add the architecture of the same.
       

### Rules
1. Pull requests must be made to develop branch.

P.S: Contributions, ideas and suggestions are welcome.
