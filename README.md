# Eureka-chat

Hi all,
       This is my our first repository which is planning to build a universal chat room. It will allow anyone in the world to join the chat and can have discussions, debates, Q&A and many more features with integration to all popular discussion sites. It will also have one-on-one chat, groups for different topics. I will add more details and also will add the architecture of the same.
       
This is great oppurtunity for beginners to learn and contribute as we are labelling it Hactoberfest. Contributions, ideas and suggestions are welcome.
